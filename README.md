# Human-Activity-Recognition
Human Activity Recognition as part of ISEN 613 Project 
The primary objective of this work is to predict the posture of subject humans in the testing data with as much accuracy and model interpretability as possible. An important part of achieving our objective is to focus on the accuracy-interpretability tradeoff and filtering out important variables.

Among all the methods used here, LDA worked the best with overall accuracy of 96.39%. It does a great job in classifying sitting and standing doing which other methods are not performing well. LDA has 100% accuracy in classifying the activity walking_upstairs. SVC and Multilabel classification with random forest algorithm performs almost as outstanding as LDA with accuracy of 96%.
